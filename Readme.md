Watson Downloader
=========

Purpose....
-----------
I made my original comic downloader for Scary Go Round, but then I wondered if I could expand it to my other favorite web comics, I've now expanded it to [Watson](http://watsonstrip.com/).

Each chapter is created every 20 comics and loaded into its own `.cbz` file. Which can be used with most comic readers. For Mac, see [Simple Comic](http://dancingtortoise.com/simplecomic/) or [Jomic](http://jomic.sourceforge.net/).

How to use...
-----------
A downloader tool for my favorite webcomic.

  - Run `bundle`
  - Run `bundle exec ruby getWatson.rb`
  - Enjoy all of Watson!

What this does....
-----------

This downloads the entirety of Watson from 2010-Present, where Jim Horwitzhas now posted over 200 comics.
